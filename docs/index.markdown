My name is Jacob Zoromski, and I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at the University of Notre Dame. I study commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, and I have a special interest in using computation to study infinite free resolutions. My advisor is Claudiu Raicu.

  <li><b>MultiRegeneration for Polynomial System Solving</b> with Colin Crowley, Jose Israel Rodriguez, and Jacob Weiker (<a href="url">arXiv:1912.04394</a>). 
    <p> We demonstrate our implementation of a continuation method as described by Hauenstein and Rodriguez for solving polynomials systems. Given a sequence of (multi)homogeneous polynomials, the software multiregeneration outputs the respective (multi)degree in a wide range of cases and partial multidegree in all others. We use Python for the file processing, while Bertini is needed for the continuation. Moreover, parallelization options and several strategies for solving structured polynomial systems are available.</p></li>
